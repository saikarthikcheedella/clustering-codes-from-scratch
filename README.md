# clustering-codes-from-scratch

Clustering is the task of dividing data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.

They are different types of clustering methods, including:
1) Partitioning methods. Ex: K- Means
2) Hierarchical clustering. Ex: Agglomerative, Divisive
3) Fuzzy clustering.
4) Density-based clustering. Ex: DBSCAN, OPTICS 
5) Model-based clustering.

Here are some techniques, implemented from the scratch:

1) K-Means: Implementation flow

2) Agglomerative Clustering (One of the Hierarchical clustering techniques): Implementation flow
