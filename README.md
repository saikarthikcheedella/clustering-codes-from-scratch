Clustering is the task of dividing data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.

They are different types of clustering methods, including:
1) Partitioning methods. Ex: K- Means
2) Hierarchical clustering. Ex: Agglomerative, Divisive
3) Fuzzy clustering.
4) Density-based clustering. Ex: DBSCAN, OPTICS 
5) Model-based clustering.

Here are for some clustering techniques written from the scracth:
1) k-means:
    
    
2) Agglomerative clustering (One of the Hierarchical clustering techniques):
