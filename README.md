# clustering-codes-from-scratch

Clustering is the task of dividing data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.

They are different types of clustering methods, including:
1) Partitioning methods. Ex: K- Means
2) Hierarchical clustering. Ex: Agglomerative, Divisive
3) Fuzzy clustering.
4) Density-based clustering. Ex: DBSCAN, OPTICS 
5) Model-based clustering.

Here I have written code for some clustering techniques from the scracth. They are:

1) k-means.

2) One of the Hierarchical clustering techniques - Agglomerative clustering.
